Some of its strengths are that it's easy to conceptualize the data with it, it allows simple decision rules in each node, and it is easy to explain the model to decision makers. Some weaknesses are that it is prone to overfitting, grows exponentially in size with each level of the tree, can be sensitive to small changes in data, and it can have problems with out-of-sample predictions.\n",

Also there doesn't seem to exist a data point that could be an extreme outlier based on the possible values for each feature.\n",

Some of its strengths are that is works well in complicated domains with large margin levels, it's effective in high dimensional spaces, and the kernel functions can allow domain knowledge to be built into the algorithm. Some weaknesses are that the cubic training time makes this not work well with large datasets, it doesn't work well with very noisy data, doesn't inherently provide probability estimates.\n",

    "3 - K-NN Classifier. A K-nearest neighbors classifier is a machine learning model that can be used for supervised classification. It is an instance based model, that stores instances of the data and does not try to make a generalized model. Some of its strengths are its training run time, it's robust to noisy training data, and is effective with large data sets. Some weakness are that it has a high computation cost since it doesn't form a predictive model with the data initially, and the K value and distance formula can make a big difference in its predictive ability.\n",

    "F<sub>1</sub> score is a measurement of a system's precision and recall ability. The F<sub>1</sub> score ranges from 0 - 1 where 1 is the best and perfectly predicts the data. Precision is a measure of how often the model predicts a label correctly compared with the total number of times it predicted that label. For instance if this model correctly identified 8 students that needed intervention and predicted 2 other students that it thought needed intervention but really didn't, then it would have a precision of .8 . Recall is the amount of times a model predicts a label correctly compared with the total number actual times that label was true. For instance if this model correctly identified 8 students that needed intervention and there were 8 other students that needed intervention that it predicted didn't need intervention, then it would have a recall of .5 .  \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides just looking at F<sub>1</sub> score, other factors to consider are the amount of data, performance, and resource costs the different models will take. All 3 of these models were appropriate based on the data, cost, and performance so the leading factor was just the best F<sub>1</sub> score. The training and prediction times for all 3 models were negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree works by asking a question and then dividing the data by the answer to that question. Then we ask another question and further divide our data set. We repeat this process until we get a result we are satisfied with. The first question we want to ask is the question that will divide the data into the least random groups. For instance a question that would be perfectly divide the data into students that needed intervention and those that do not would be the pefect question to ask. Fortunately our algorithm finds this best question for us automatically. \n",
